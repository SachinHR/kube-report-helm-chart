## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via email to **[skubesuite@gmail.com](mailto:skubesuite@gmail.com)**. This email is managed by the core maintainers of the project and is kept private.

We strive to respond to reports within **2-3 business days**. If your report concerns a **critical issue** that could affect user safety or system integrity, please indicate this urgency in the email subject.

#### Information to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, providing the following details can help us address the issue more efficiently:

- The specific commit or release version where the issue was identified.
- A clear proof of concept (text format preferred; please avoid sending binaries).
- Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any potential fixes or recommendations you might have.

Our team consists of volunteers, so we might reach out for further clarification if needed.

> **Important**: Please do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities on GitHub. Publicly disclosing such issues may put users at risk before a patch is available. Instead, use the private email provided above to ensure responsible disclosure.
